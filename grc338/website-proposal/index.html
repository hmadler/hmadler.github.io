         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>Suit Up</p>
         <p>Suit Up is a clothing label that creates loungewear for the streets. Sweatshirt and sweatpant sets have taken over the fashion world. Suit Up has recognized the need for graphic sweatsuit sets at a relatively cheaper price, compared to the sets that currently go for $300+ dollars. The site is an e-commerce website that will allow customers to browse and shop the sweatsuit sets from the comfort of their own home!</p>
         <h2>Target audience</h2>
         <p>The people using this site will be of ages 14-30, targeting high school and college students, as well as young adults. </p>
         <p>Our customers are people who value good style, but don’t want to jeopardize being comfortable. They are often on-the-go, which is why they choose clothing that fits their active lifestyle. Wearing sweatpants isn’t seen as lazy anymore, as long as they are designed with style in mind. When customers wear our sets, they'll continue to look put together whether they're running errands, going to class, or meeting a friend for coffee.</p>
